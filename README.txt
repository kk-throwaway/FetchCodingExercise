To the reviewer:

I took the directions as literally as possible, so the secondary sorting 
was by name, not by ID. This means that the names are technically in 
alphabetical order, and not in the numerical order of the id that corresponds 
to the name. For the sorting, the more intuitive way would have been to do it 
using RxJava operators, however, there was no clean way to compare two strings 
this way, so I wrote a short method to do it.

The app's error handling involves showing a message when the data doesn't load 
properly, which can be clicked to try to load again.

If you would prefer me to use a different library to accomplish some of the 
tasks, or you would like to see anything done differently within the app,
please let me know and I will change it.

Thank You,
Kevin Kirwan
