To the reviewer:

I took the directions as literally as possible, so the secondary sorting 
was by name, not by ID. This means that the names are technically in 
alphabetical order, and not in the numerical order of the id that corresponds 
to the name. For the sorting, the more intuitive way would have been to do it 
using RxJava operators, however, there was no clean way to compare two strings 
this way, so I wrote a short method to do it

The app's error handling involves showing a message when the data doesn't load 
properly, which can be clicked to try to load again.

If there is any issue with the libraries I used, or the way anything involving 
the layout, please let me know and I can resubmit.

Thank You,
Kevin Kirwan
